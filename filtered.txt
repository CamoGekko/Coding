The Fight Continues | Internet Archive Blogs
Today’s lower court decision in Hachette v. Internet Archive is a blow to all libraries and the communities we serve. This decision impacts libraries across the US who rely on controlled digital lending to connect their patrons with books online. It hurts authors by saying that unfair licensing models are the only way their books can be read online. And it holds back access to information in the digital age, harming all readers, everywhere.
But it’s not over—we will keep fighting for the traditional right of libraries to own, lend, and preserve books. We will be appealing the judgment and encourage everyone to come together as a community to support libraries against this attack by corporate publishers.

Rust's 2018 roadmap | Rust Blog

Each year the Rust community comes together to set out a
roadmap. This year, in addition to the survey, we put out
a call for blog posts in December, which resulted
in 100 blog posts written over the span of a few weeks. The end
result is the recently-merged 2018 roadmap RFC.

I use kiosk mode in Microsoft Edge Legacy—how will this affect me?

You will need to set up kiosk mode in the new Microsoft Edge. Please see this blog for details and recommendations for kiosk mode.

Will this affect other apps that use EdgeHTML?

To get help, we offer a variety of support options. If you have Microsoft Unified Support, you can reach out to that support service for help with the transition. There’s also FastTrack which is available at no additional charge to customers with 150 or more paid seats of Windows 10 Enterprise. And if you prefer to get started on your own, we have self-guided deployment and configuration materials, complete with a series from Microsoft Mechanics, ready for you on our Docs site.

Finally, if you run into compatibility or app issues as you transition to the new Microsoft Edge, there’s App Assure. The App Assure promise is this: if your web apps and sites work on IE 11, supported versions of Google Chrome, or any version of Microsoft Edge (including Microsoft Edge Legacy), those web apps and sites should work on the new Microsoft Edge. If not, you can contact App Assure at no additional cost for remediation support or by email if you experience any challenges submitting your request (ACHELP@microsoft.com). You can also read more about App Assure and Microsoft Edge in this blog.

Where can I learn more about the Windows 10 release as it becomes available?

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.Privacy CheckupLooking to change your privacy settings?Take the Privacy CheckupEffective March 28, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDFContentsIntroductionInformation Google collectsWhy Google collects dataYour privacy controlsSharing your informationKeeping your information secureExporting & deleting your informationRetaining your informationCompliance & cooperation with regulatorsAbout this policyRelated privacy practicesWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google HomePlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating systemProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google MapsYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.Information Google collectsWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our servicesWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers & devicesWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.Your activityWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:Terms you search forVideos you watchViews and interactions with content and adsVoice and audio informationPurchase activityPeople with whom you communicate or share contentActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google AccountIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.Go to Google AccountYour location informationWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:GPS and other sensor data from your deviceIP addressActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or workInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devicesThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.Why Google collects dataWe use data to build better servicesWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:Provide our servicesWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.Maintain & improve our servicesWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalized services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in  My Ad Center.We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.Go to My Ad CenterMeasure performanceWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.Communicate with youWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users, and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.Your privacy controlsYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's usedThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.Go to Privacy CheckupManaging, reviewing, and updating your informationWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:Privacy controlsActivity ControlsDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.Go to Activity ControlsAd settingsManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.Sharing your informationWhen you share your informationMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.When Google shares your informationWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:With your consentWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.With domain administratorsIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:Access and retain information stored in your account, like your emailView statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you installChange your account passwordSuspend or terminate your account accessReceive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental requestRestrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settingsFor external processingWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.For legal reasonsWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:Respond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.Keeping your information secureWe build security into our services to protect your informationAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:We use encryption to keep your data private while in transitWe offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your accountWe review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systemsWe restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.Exporting & deleting your informationYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any timeYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.Export your dataTo delete your information, you can:Delete your content from specific Google servicesSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My ActivityDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those productsDelete your entire Google AccountDelete your informationRetaining your informationWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.Compliance & cooperation with regulatorsWe regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.Data transfersWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.U.S. state law requirementsSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.We explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).We explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.The Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.When you use these tools, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.We also provide more information on Google’s handling of CCPA requests.Some U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.Categories of information we collectIdentifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. Some Google services like YouTube Studio provide the option to submit a valid ID (such as a passport or driver’s license) to verify your identity to use additional features.Demographic information, such as your age, gender and language. If you choose to use optional features like YouTube Creator Demographics, you can also provide additional information, like your gender identity or race and ethnicity.Commercial information such as your payment information and a history of purchases you make on Google’s services.Biometric information if you choose to provide it, such as fingerprints in Google’s product development studies.Internet, network, and other activity information such as your search terms; views and interactions with content and ads; Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account; information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services (like IP address, crash reports, and system activity); and activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services. You can review and control activity data stored in your Google Account in My Activity.Geolocation data, such as may be determined by GPS, IP address, and other data from sensors on or around your device, depending in part on your device and account settings.

It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.Browser web storageBrowser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.CookiesA cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.DeviceA device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.Google AccountYou may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.IP addressEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information.Non-personally identifiable informationThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.Personal informationThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.Pixel tagA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.Referrer URLA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.Sensitive personal informationThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.Server logsLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -740674ce2123e969123.45.67.89 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query.http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query.Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 is the browser and operating system being used.740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).Unique identifiersA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.Additional ContextActivity on Google ServicesIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.You can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.activity on third-party sites and apps that use our servicesWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use.

In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.devicesFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.ensure and improveFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.ensure our services are working as intendedFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.Information about things near your deviceIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn morelegal process, or enforceable governmental requestLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.make improvementsFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.may link informationGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn moreour usersFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

Learn morepersonalized adsYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn morephone numberIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn morePlaces you label like home and workYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.protect against abuseFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).publicly accessible sourcesFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.rely on cookies to function properlyFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn moresafety and reliabilitySome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn moresensitive categoriesWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity.

For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn moreIf you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.Views and interactions with content and adsFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.Voice and audio informationFor example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn moreyour activity on other sites and appsThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.Change language:AfrikaansBahasa IndonesiaBahasa MelayuCatalàČeštinaDanskDeutschEestiEnglishEnglish (India)English (United Kingdom)EspañolEspañol (Latinoamérica)EuskaraFilipinoFrançaisFrançais (Canada)GalegoHrvatskiIsizuluÍslenskaItalianoKiswahiliLatviešuLietuviųMagyarNederlandsNorskPolskiPortuguês (Brasil)Português (Portugal)RomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSrpskiSuomiSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάБългарскиРусскийСрпскиУкраїнська‫עברית‬‫اردو‬‫العربية‬‫فارسی‬አማርኛमराठीहिन्दीবাংলাગુજરાતીதமிழ்తెలుగుಕನ್ನಡമലയാളംไทย한국어中文 (香港)中文（简体中文）中文（繁體中文）日本語GoogleAbout GooglePrivacyTermsTransparency CenterGoogle appsMain menu

While some are freelancing full-time, many people are also doing so part-time as a side hustle.  If you yourself are considering a side gig, there are many ways to dive in. You can write people's video game profiles, get paid to pretend to be someone on their dating profiles or even get paid to stand in line for people.With so many options available, "the question is, what do you do?" says Kathy Kristof, founder and CEO of Sidehusl.com. Or, what qualities do you have "that are fairly unique?"Here are three high-paying, in-demand side hustles to consider according to Kristof and Daniella Flores, founder of side hustle blog I Like to Dabble.SEO consulting"Marketing is giant," Kristof says. Social media marketing, for instance, is a service she sees a lot of demand for. "There's a huge need for people who know how to do SEO" as well, she says.Search engine optimization helps websites gain more traffic by considering keywords people type in to look for like content. If you're interested in learning how it works, there are all sorts of online courses on sites like Coursera and tutorials by Google itself.SEO experts on Upwork are currently charging as much as $250 per hour.CybersecurityWith so much of people's lives happening online, "cybersecurity is in extremely high demand and that will probably last forever," says Kristof, adding that "the threats become more sophisticated and tougher to stop."DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income onlineIf you're interested in diving in, "you don't need a college degree, but Google, IBM, Apple, all of these big tech companies offer very inexpensive, sometimes free courses in cybersecurity," she says. Various colleges and universities offer them as well, and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies lists a number of certifications to consider.When you take the courses, "you're often connected to the people who are going to hire you in the end," says Kristof.Cybersecurity experts on Fiverr are charging as much as $1,480 per project.CodingFinally, another high paying hustle in the tech world is coding. "The part-time demand for it is so high, especially with AI and the need to train all of these new AI platforms," says Flores, who goes by they/them pronouns.Many people in the field have degrees in computer science, but that's not necessarily a prerequisite. There are coding boot camps available online through sites like Codeacademy and various universities, and they can be enough to get started.Flores recommends offering your services through sites like Data Annotation Tech. "It's kind of like a coding temp agency," they say. To register, you'll need to take an assessment test. But once you pass, "they do guarantee work for everybody," they say. One user reported making about $23 per hour, though Flores says coders can make as much as $50 per hour through the site.Flores also recommends using LinkedIn to look for jobs."A lot of people, when they're hiring for freelancers, no matter the project, they will put up a post on their page" as opposed to creating a job listing on the site. Flores recommends doing a keyword search for posts including phrases like web development freelancer, freelance coder, etc. to find opportunities.Coders on Upwork are charging as much as $200 per hour.Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

How to start a passive income side hustle: Realistic tips from expertsSkip NavigationRelated StoriesSide HustlesHow to start a successful side hustle: Tips from 4 people who've done itSide Hustles35-year-old making $11,400 a week in passive income: How I build my side hustlesSide HustlesThis 38-year-old makes $160,000 per month in passive income: 'I work only 5 hours a week now'How I Made ItCouple started a side hustle 'to pay rent and survive'—now it brings in $2.2M/moSide HustlesHow this 23-year-old built a side hustle that brings in $10,300 a monthJannese Torres is the founder of the blog Delish D'Lites and the podcast "Yo Quiero Dinero."Photo Jannese TorresStarting a passive income side hustle may look quick and easy on TikTok. In real life, it usually takes time and effort to start, and maintain, a business that brings in cash while you're actively not working."Don't put unnecessary pressure on yourself to create a six-figure business in two weeks," Jannese Torres, a 39-year-old blogger and podcaster who makes $9,300 per month in passive income, wrote for CNBC Make It last week. "That's not realistic, despite what social media may tell you."So, what is realistic? Make It spoke with a group of experts who've built passive income businesses and scaled them into six-figure successes.Here are their top four pieces of advice for starting and growing your own:Use your past experienceYour side hustle's success can come down to how you apply your personal and professional strengths to your business. For JP Mancini II, a previous career in sales at a car dealership helped him build a successful boat-rental business, he told Make It last year.It equipped him with some necessary customer service and marketing skills, and taught him the value of owning luxury products that could actually hold some resale value over time, he said. From January 2022 to January 2023, his two boats — one in Hampton, Virginia, and another in Key West, Florida — brought in more than $466,500 in revenue, according to documents reviewed by Make It.JP Mancini II turned his boat chartering side hustle into mostly passive six-figure income.JP Mancini IIIt took time, and cash, to launch the side hustle: Mancini spent 300 hours researching what kind of boats to buy, and as of last year, was working to pay down $550,000 in debt from the boat purchases.But the job came with rewards: Mancini only worked 30 minutes per day, which gives him more time to travel and enjoy time on the water, he said. He stood out on boat-rental platforms like Boatsetter and GetMyBoat because he knows how to craft a customer experience in the luxury sector, he added."I was born to be a salesperson," Mancini said. "When you really understand sales, you know there's only two reasons people buy things: to fix a problem, or because they love something. I think you have to understand the psychological aspect of why people spend an exorbitant amount of money [on anything]."Set small goals — and gamify your processLast year, web developer Ryan Hogue made more than $1,600 a day, or roughly $11,400 per week, largely in passive income, according to documents reviewed by Make It. But when he launched his first attempt at passive income — a print-on-demand business — in 2016, he only made $4 per day for his first couple of months, he told Make It last week.Instead of getting hung up on the dollar figure, he set a small goal of simply doubling his money. ″[My friends] would just laugh at me — 'Dude, cool. $8?' — but in my head I knew that I could double that, and double it again," he said during a Make It panel at SXSW in March.Ryan Hogue, 35, left his web development career in 2020 to focus on building passive income streams.Ryan HogueGamifying his side hustle made him feel like he was making progress, even if the dollar amounts were still pretty low, he said. Today, Hogue has at least 15 streams of income, including online courses, one-on-one coaching and a YouTube channel.Hogue still works a lot — roughly 60 hours per week — because his goal with passive income isn't necessarily to create leisure time for himself, he said. Rather, he tries to constantly find new side hustles, gamify them until they're making him money, and then automate them so he can use his time to find new challenges.Keep close track of your business's financesYou have to designate time, and systems, to keep track of your finances, according to Torres.Torres, a former process engineer, learned a lot about finances while running a Puerto Rican food blog called Delish D'Lites throughout the 2010s. In 2019, she started another side project: a money podcast called Yo Quiero Dinero, or "I want money" in Spanish.The foray into personal finance spawned a slew of other businesses, and in 2020, Torres decided she wanted to quit her full-time job. She started tracking her finances on spreadsheets so she could consistently gauge how close she was to making that dream a reality.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income onlineAfter roughly a year, Torres left her engineering role. She now has seven income streams, including affiliating marketing and ads, Airbnb rental income and digital courses. Basic spreadsheets are no longer enough to track her expenses, so she invests in accounting software like QuickBooks, Wave or Xero.The software helps her separate her personal and business finances, set a budget and "cut out unnecessary expenses in real time," she wrote. She also recommended putting aside 25% of business revenue for taxes, and finding a consultant to understand your obligations and deadlines.Continually connect with and listen to your audiencePassive income may trim the hours you spend clocked into work — but you still have to keep up with the wants and needs of your consumers. Luckily, your audience usually will tell you what they're looking for, Jasmine McCall wrote for Make It in 2022.Three years ago, McCall was making $124,000 per year as an Amazon resource manager. She also made YouTube videos sharing money and career advice, and one of them — about how she upped her credit score to 836, from 495 — went viral.Commenters started requesting more credit advice, leading her to develop a digital DIY credit boost kit, available for purchase. The package includes tools like a credit dispute roadmap and step-by-step video lessons, according to McCall's website.Photo: Jasmine McCallNext, she built a digital resume kit including interview preparation guides and templates for resumes, cover letters, references and thank you letters. Between YouTube and the digital products, it took less than a year for McCall's side hustle sales to outpace her 9-to-5 salary, she wrote.She quit her Amazon job in May 2022. As of March, McCall and her husband bring in $143,000 per month in passive income, according to documents reviewed by Make It. Her YouTube channel has more than half a million subscribers, who tune in for personal finance tips, side hustle leads and homebuying hacks.One of her keys to success, she wrote, is still keeping in touch with her viewers. She works just 10 hours per week these days, spending much of the rest of her time with her husband and toddler.Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

Box's Dallas-based marketing company, now called LTK, helped pioneer the modern creator economy, connecting influencers and bloggers with retail brands' advertising dollars. It was most recently valued at $2 billion, after a 2021 investment from Japanese investment holding company SoftBank.In true early 2010s fashion, that journey started with an unpaid blog. Specifically, a fashion blog: After working as a fit model, an intern at Thakoon and an assistant buyer at a luxury boutique, Box wanted to build an online presence as a personal shopper.The problem with that strategy, Box says, is that people could take free fashion advice from her blog without actually hiring her. Early fashion bloggers weren't yet commonly using affiliate marketing technology, where websites drive traffic to a retailer's online shop in exchange for a cut of those eventual sales.But the concept of affiliate marketing was intriguing to Box, who saw it as a way to apply her personal shopping business model to her blog and turn it into a profitable full-time job. She asked her then-boyfriend, an electrical engineer and tech analyst named Baxter Box — today, they're married with four kids — if he could help.They each spent $500 to $1,000 of their own money to build a website that could accommodate affiliate links, she estimates. When they realized they could sell similar tech to other bloggers, RewardStyle was born.At the time, Box had only "$260-something in my bank account," she says.The couple scraped together an additional $1,000 from friends and family, some of which went toward renting a single-room residential apartment as their first office space, says Box."I told the leasing agent, 'We're going to run a business here. I probably will sleep here a lot too. Is that OK?' He's like, 'Fine with me,'" Box says.They hired a software engineer to help run the site and used liquidation sales to furnish their office space. "We found a defunct business in Fort Worth and drove over in Suburbans and trucks, and loaded up some chairs and some desks," says Box. "For my birthday that year, I got a Keurig, so our sole engineer was happy that he had coffee."Today, LTK employs more than 800 people, and hundreds of thousands of online creators have used its platform to earn at least $2.7 billion in total payouts from retailers since 2011, according to the company. Over that time, the platform has helped 240 influencers — all women — become millionaires, Box says."Our mission has always been to make creators as economically successful as possible," she says. "[LTK] started because I wanted to move out of my dad's house, I wanted to keep making money as a personal shopper and I wanted my friends to be able to do the same."Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

She didn't intend to help create an entire online industry.The 36-year-old is the co-founder and president of LTK, a Dallas-based marketing company that connects more than 250,000 influencers and bloggers with over 7,000 retail brands with advertising budgets to spend. She's credited as a pioneer of the creator economy with a business most recently valued at $2 billion, following a 2021 fundraise from Japanese investment holding company SoftBank.In 2010, Box was an unpaid fashion blogger trying to promote her services as a personal shopper. She'd held some low-level positions in the industry: a fit model, an intern at Thakoon, an assistant buyer at a luxury boutique in Dallas.When an article in The Dallas Morning News pointed readers to her blog, Box realized she'd made a mistake: Potential clients were reading her fashion tips and buying the clothes themselves. She wasn't making a penny, and affiliate marketing — where blogs link out to retailers in exchange for a cut of sales — wasn't yet commonly used in the fashion industry."That was an 'aha moment' of, I have to modernize my business so that I can actually continue to charge for the sales that I'm driving to my customers," Box tells CNBC Make It. "That was the impetus for us starting [in 2011] what was RewardStyle, and is now LTK."She and her then-boyfriend, an electrical engineer and tech analyst named Baxter Box — they're now married with four kids — adapted existing affiliate linking tech to fit her blog. Once she started making money, she realized she could sell the technology to other bloggers, who could benefit similarly.Since launching, LTK has helped online creators earn at least $2.7 billion in payouts from retailers, according to the company. It has turned 240 influencers — all women — into millionaires, Box says.Here, Box discusses the challenges of launching LTK, the risks of completely devoting yourself to an uncertain venture and where any aspiring entrepreneur should begin.CNBC Make It: Can you describe the process of turning your fashion blog into an online business?Box: [Baxter] saw me really struggling. We went for a walk one day, and he was like, "Anything's on the table. How would you want to make money on this?"My old business model [as a personal shopper] involved getting paid a commission. That seemed fair. That's what I wanted to do here. So he researched and found some technology that we could apply back to this space.I put between $500 to $1,000 towards engineering to get this going, and he did the same. I drew up, on PowerPoint, what I wanted it to look like. We met with this guy on the weekends and paid him piecemeal, hourly, to start coding it. In 2011, we launched and I was able to start earning commissions.Did starting a business feel like a big personal risk?There was also almost no [financial] downside. I was in my early 20s, living at home, still eating my dad's cereal. Worst case, this stays the same. Best case, you have a business where you get to do the things you want within this lifestyle that you wanted to create.But there was a pressure of, "This better work, because I'm sacrificing everything to make it happen. And what if I do this for X period of time and it doesn't? That's going to just be this huge hole and pit in my life."I was spending 24 hours a day [on the business]. I was silencing phone calls. I was not spending time with friends. I abandoned a lot of relationships, and very quickly.How confident were you that this would become a viable business beyond your own blog?I was confident that people would be excited about it. Bloggers didn't make money [at the time], and I knew that the second they made $100, that they would want to keep doing this. But I really didn't know how we were going to pay the bills that we were incurring from hiring an intern, hiring an engineer.One of the biggest challenges with retailers was getting them to believe that someone who had a website on the internet should be part of their marketing plan. The feedback I would often get was: "We work with celebrities or models. This is not part of our plan. We are a luxury brand, we are elevated."There were two key businesses at the time that were selling [luxury items] online, ShopBop and Net-a-Porter. I basically asked them to pay me a commission for the online sales that I was driving, and that's when the business really took off.You started LTK before most people knew the term "creator economy." Did you feel like you were ahead of the curve?No, I really didn't even think of it as an industry. I struggled until 2015, when we fundraised for the first time, to try and explain the space that we were creating — articulate it in a way that investors were interested in.I was talking about blogging, young girls on the internet, fashion. I was a young girl. This was my first business and I was from Dallas. It was very challenging to get investors excited about it and raise money around it. Most of the comments were like, "I'll ask my wife," or "I'll ask my girlfriend."We raised $300 million [from SoftBank] in 2021. I think it's probably one of the largest investments, if not the largest, in the creator space. That was when the industry, to me, really arrived.What's your best advice for recognizing a window of opportunity and deciding to commit to pursuing it?The time isn't "always now" — it's always yesterday. If you have a real problem, then other people have that problem too. Solve it now, because someone is going to eventually be able to solve it.It's who gets there fastest, spreads the word and builds that community around it best. And that's with almost every decision as a founder — you move with urgency to win.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

The feedback I would often get was: "We work with celebrities or models. This is not part of our plan. We are a luxury brand, we are elevated."There were two key businesses at the time that were selling [luxury items] online, ShopBop and Net-a-Porter. I basically asked them to pay me a commission for the online sales that I was driving, and that's when the business really took off.You started LTK before most people knew the term "creator economy." Did you feel like you were ahead of the curve?No, I really didn't even think of it as an industry. I struggled until 2015, when we fundraised for the first time, to try and explain the space that we were creating — articulate it in a way that investors were interested in.I was talking about blogging, young girls on the internet, fashion. I was a young girl. This was my first business and I was from Dallas. It was very challenging to get investors excited about it and raise money around it. Most of the comments were like, "I'll ask my wife," or "I'll ask my girlfriend."We raised $300 million [from SoftBank] in 2021. I think it's probably one of the largest investments, if not the largest, in the creator space. That was when the industry, to me, really arrived.What's your best advice for recognizing a window of opportunity and deciding to commit to pursuing it?The time isn't "always now" — it's always yesterday. If you have a real problem, then other people have that problem too. Solve it now, because someone is going to eventually be able to solve it.It's who gets there fastest, spreads the word and builds that community around it best. And that's with almost every decision as a founder — you move with urgency to win.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

I followed my dream in a practical way — working a corporate 9-to-5 as an audio engineer while growing a business as a freelance music producer for indie artists on the side.But in 2009, at age 26, I lost my job and decided to take my production business full-time.We still struggled to make ends meet, though. I made between $800 and $1,000 per month, while my wife earned between $500 and $1,000 per month as a photographer. On top of our freelance income, we lived off our savings and food stamps. We also became new parents. That's when the financial pressures really started to kick in.So later that year, I decided to start a music blog — The Recording Revolution — out of desperation to make more money. I figured that having an online presence would help me land more production clients.It took me some time to learn how to turn it into a profitable business. But fast forward to 2022, and I'm making more money from my online businesses than I ever did as a producer.The Recording Revolution alone grosses $40,000 per month. I also bring in $120,000 per month in gross sales through my online coaching business, which teaches clients exactly what I did to make The Recording Revolution a success.At 38, I've achieved something incredible: Between my two businesses, I work only five hours per week now, and I get to spend the rest of my time with my family.How I turned my passion into a businessI started the Recording Revolution as a blog and YouTube channel to share what I know about music and attract more clients for my production business.Graham Cochrane works an average of five hours per week, and spends the rest of the time with his family.Photo: Graham CochraneAt first, I posted three blogs on my website and one video on YouTube per week. I shared quick, step-by-step instructions for different recording and editing techniques, along with product reviews and interviews with musicians and producers.In my first year on YouTube, I saw my daily views jump from about 60 views per day to 2,000 per day. As my audience grew, I saw an opportunity to monetize my content.Initially, I made $200 to $1,000 per month through video sponsorships and ad revenue. To land these deals, I created a press kit sharing my website traffic and reader demographics, and sent it to brands that made products my audience would like. In my outreach, I offered them spots in my YouTube videos or banner ad spots on my blog.But in 2010, I found the key to a more lucrative business: Building and launching my own digital products, like eBooks or online courses, that teach people valuable skills I picked up throughout my career.How I make $160,000 per month in passive incomeIn April 2010, I created and sold my first online course, which taught customers how to use the popular recording software Pro Tools for $45.I used a screen recording software called Screenflow to capture my computer screen and my voice as I demonstrated how Pro Tools worked.Before recording, I wrote a basic outline of what parts of the software I wanted to share and in what order, then spent three to four hours recording and editing the content.People recommended starting an email list to market my courses. To attract subscribers, I offered a free eBook. I had about 500 subscribers by the time I sold my first online course.I started scaling back on my freelance production business in 2012. Today, I sell dozens of online courses and members-only online communities through The Recording Revolution. Prices range from $67 to $397.From October 2018 to September 2019, I brought in $1 million in sales. And in 2021, after stepping away from producing day-to-day content, The Recording Revolution brought in about $40,000 per month.My second business, which teaches people how to monetize their knowledge and passions like I did, launched in 2018. Over the last six months, I've generated $120,000 per month in passive income from an online course called the Automatic Income Academy, my Six-Figure Coaching Community, a high-level business coaching program called The Epic Mastermind, and affiliate commissions from a company called Kajabi. Right now, roughly 2,800 business owners are using my coaching products. The goal is to help them grow an online business while working fewer hours.My best tips for aspiring entrepreneursStarting my online side hustle — then committing to it full-time — changed my life. My original dream to be a musician has been replaced by what I'm doing now: Helping people live a more lucrative, flexible and meaningful life.If you're an aspiring entrepreneur, here are my top three tips to help skyrocket your earnings:1. Sell your skills to earn passive income.When you're offering a service, there are two main dials you can turn to make more money: getting more clients and raising your rates. But this can be a problem because there are only so many hours in a day to take on clients, and there is always a limit to how much you can charge in your industry.The turning point for me was when I got the idea to turn my knowledge of audio mixing and recording into an online course. Selling digital products provided a passive income stream and allowed me to make far more money in a day — while putting in less time — than I did working as a freelancer.2. Give people a free sample of what you can offer.A core belief of mine is that givers prosper. My entire business is built around giving the best free educational content, even when I could charge for it. That's why I have a blog, YouTube channel and podcast. It seems counterintuitive, but here's why it works: Every piece of value-rich content I put out in the world acts as a magnet to draw people in, through the power of a Google or YouTube search. It's a way for people to discover and build trust with me.Then, when I do sell a premium product, they are ready and willing to pay for it.3. Build automatic systems.Working only five hours per week helps me avoid burnout and allows me to spend more time with my family. This wouldn't be possible without having automatic systems in place.For example, almost all of my marketing and follow-up communications with clients happen through automatic emails.When people find my content, they have the option to sign up for more exclusive content via email. Once we're in contact, I have dozens of pre-written emails that automatically send. These emails offer business insights, tips and techniques, but also share which of my products they'll benefit from the most.Focusing on email means that I don't spend hours on social media soliciting people in their DMs. I let content and email automation do the heavy lifting for me.Graham Cochrane is founder of The Recording Revolution, author of "How to Get Paid for What You Know" and is a business coach to over 2,800 customers worldwide.
