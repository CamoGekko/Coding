What if D- Day had failed and Germany had defeated the Allies in Europe? After the conference in Tehran, Roosevelt headed to Cairo, Egypt, where he and Church ill continued planning an invasion of France that would force Germany to ag ain fight the war on two fronts. One major decision, however, still had to be made. The president had to choose the commander for Operation Overlord (the code name for the invasion. Roosevelt selected General Eisenho wer. The select ion of a site for the largest amphibious landing in history was one of the biggest decisions of World War II. Allied planners considered coastlines fr om Denmark to Portugal in search of a sheltered location with firm flat bea ches within range of friendly fighter planes in England. There also had to be enough roads and paths to move jeeps and trucks off the beaches and to a ccommodate the hundreds of thousands of American, Canadian, and British tro ops set to stream ashore following the invasion. An airfield and a seaport that the Allies could use were also needed. However, a reasonable expectati on of achieving the element of surprise was most important. Hitler had fortified the French coast along the English Channel, but he did not know when or where the Allies would land. The Germans believed the landing would be in Pas-de-Calais(the area of France closest to Britain. The All ies encouraged this belief by placing dummy equipment along the coast acros s from Calais. The real target was farther south, a 60-mile stretch of five beaches along the Normandy coast.

Planners a lso discussed who should lead France after the invasion. General Eisenhower had informed Brigadier General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the French Resistance movement against Nazi occupation, that the French Resistance fo rces would assist in the liberation of Paris. But President Roosevelt was n ot sure he trusted de Gaulle and refused to recognize him as the official F rench leader. By the spr ing of 1944, more than 1.5 million American soldiers, 12,000 airplanes, and 5 million tons of equipment had been sent to England. Setting the invasion date and giving the command to go were all that remained of the preparatio ns. The invasion had to begin at night to hide the ships crossing the Engli sh Channel, and the ships had to arrive at low tide so that they could see beach obstacles. The low tide had to come at dawn so that gunners bombardin g the coast could see their targets. Paratroopers, who would be dropped beh ind enemy lines, needed a moonlit night to see where to land. Most importan t of all was good weather. A storm would ground the airplanes, and high wav es would swamp landing craft. Planners a lso discussed who should lead France after the invasion.

Most impo rtant of all was good weather. A storm would ground the airplanes, and high waves would swamp landing craft. Given all these requirements, there were only a few days each month to begin the inva sion. The first opportunity was from June 5 to 7, 1944. EisenhowerE28099 s planning staff referred to the day any operation began by the letter D. T he invasion date came to be known as D-Day. Heavy clou d cover, strong winds, and high waves made June 5 impossible. The weather w as forecast to improve slightly a day later. The Channel would still be rou gh, but the landing ships and aircraft could operate. After looking at fore casts one last time, shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, General Eisenh ower gave the final order: E2809COK, weE28099ll go.E2809D Nearly 7,0 00 ships carrying more than 100,000 soldiers headed for NormandyE28099s coast. At the same time, 23,000 paratroopers were dropped inland, east and west of the beaches. Allied fighter-bombers raced up and down the coast, hi tting bridges, bunkers, and radar sites.

Explore each of the four slides with the button s below them. The im age suggests the soldiers, likely under fire from the Germans, would charge up the beach and make their way inland. Omaha Beac h, however, was a different story. Surrounded at both ends by cliffs that r ose wall-like from the sea, Omaha Beach was only four miles long. A 150-foo t-high bluff overlooked the entire beach, and there were only five ravines that allowed any sort of access from the beach to the top of the bluff. The Germans had made full use of the geographic advantage the high bluff gave them. They dug trenches and built concrete bunkers for machine guns at the top of the cliffs and positioned them to guard the ravines leading from the bluff to the beach.

By the end of the day, nearly 35,000 American troops had landed at Omaha, and another 23,000 had landed at Utah. More than 75,000 British and Canadian troops we re on shore as well. The invasion had succeeded. Becaus e German defenses were weak at Utah Beach, Allied troops were able to captu re the beach quickly and suffered relatively few casualties. At Omaha Beach , the Germans had a geographic advantage because of the high cliffs. Casual ties were high, and the assault almost failed. GUIDING QUESTION Why was th e Battle of the Bulge so important to Allied forces? Although D -Day had been a success, it was only the beginning. Surrounding many fields in Normandy were hedgerows(dirt walls, several feet thick, covered in shrubbery(built to fence in cattle and crops. They also enabled the Germans to fiercely defend their positions. The battle of the hedgerow s ended on July 25, 1944, when 2,500 U.S. bombers blew a hole in the German lines, enabling U.S. tanks to race through the gap. As the All ies broke out of Normandy, the French Resistance(French civilians w ho had secretly organized to resist the German occupation(staged a rebellion in Paris. When the Allies liberated Paris on August 25, the stree ts were filled with French citizens celebrating their victory. As the All ies advanced toward the German border, Hitler decided to stage one last des perate offensive. His goal was to cut off Allied supplies coming through th e port of Antwerp, Belgium. The attack began just before dawn on December 16, 1944. Six inches (15 cm) of snow co vered the ground, and the weather was bitterly cold. Moving rapidly, the Ge rmans caught the American defenders by surprise. As the German troops raced west, their lines bulged outward, and the attack became known as the Battl e of the Bulge. Eisenhower ordered General Patton to the rescue. Three days later, faster than anyone expected in the midst of a snowstorm, PattonE28099s troops slammed into the German lines. As the weather cleared, Allied aircraft began hitting Ge rman fuel depots. On Christm as Eve, out of fuel and weakened by heavy losses, the German troops driving toward Antwerp were forced to halt. Two days later, PattonE28099s troop s broke through the German line. Fighting continued for three weeks, but th e United States had won the Battle of the Bulge. On January 8, the Germans began to withdraw, having suffered more than 100,000 casual ties. They had very few resources left to prevent the Allies from entering Germany. U.S. t roops march near Murrigen, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge in Janua ry 1945. Soldiers were fighting in extreme winter conditions, which affected them physically and mentally, and made it hard to operate equipment such as guns and tanks. Soviet tro ops crossed GermanyE28099s eastern border, while American forces attacke d its western border. By the end of February 1945, American troops had reac hed the Rhine River, GermanyE28099s last major line of defense in the we st. On March 7, American tanks crossed the Rhine. As German defenses crumbl ed, American troops raced east to within 70 miles (113 km) of Berlin.

The Allies invaded Sicily in hopes that Italy would quit the w ar once their homeland was invaded. Po ssible responses: It is likely the war would have dragged on for another ye ar or more and German morale would have been strengthened. Th e massive casualties inflicted on the German army weakened Germany enough t o allow the Allies to cross the German border. 4.

D-Day Invasion General Eisenhower D-Day Invasion Stripes Beach Landing at Normandy Throughout D-Day, C oast Guard landing barges brought wave after wave of American soldiers acro ss the English Channel to reinforce the beachheads of Normandy, France. As t he Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower commanded the All ied troops at the invasion of Normandy. Here he talks to U.S. paratroopers in England on June 5, 1944, the day before the D-Day invasion. Shortly before the D-Day invasion, the Allies pain ted every invading Allied aircraft with alternating black and white stripes so that they could be distinguished from enemy aircraft in the crowded, ch aotic skies of battle. They instructed gunners and pilots to shoot dow n any aircraft without stripes.
