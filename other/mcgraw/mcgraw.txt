GUIDING QUESTION
Why did Germany violate the Treaty of Versailles?
World War II had its beginnings in the unchecked aggression that grew from totalitarian governments. In Germany, Adolf Hitler believed that Germans belonged to a so-called Aryan race that was superior to all other races and nationalities. Consequently, he believed that Germany was capable of building a great civilization. To be a world power, however, Hitler thought that Germany needed more land to support a larger population.
In the 1920s, Hitler had indicated that a Nazi regime would find this land to the east(in the Soviet Union. This meant Germany must prepare for war with the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union had been conquered, according to Hitler, its land would be resettled by German peasants. The Slavic peoples could be used as slave labor to build an Aryan racial state that Hitler believed could dominate Europe for a thousand years.
After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles had limited Germany's military power. As chancellor, Hitler posed as a man of peace and stressed that Germany wished to revise the unfair provisions of the treaty by peaceful means. Germany, he said, only wanted its rightful place among the European states. On March 9, 1935, however, Hitler announced the creation of a new air force. One week later, he began a military draft that would expand Germany's army from 100,000 to 550,000 troops. These steps were in direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles. France, Great Britain, and Italy condemned Germany's actions and warned against future aggressive steps. However, these nations did nothing further. This was because the world was in the middle of the Great Depression. Nations were distracted by internal problems, and the terrors of World War I were still fresh in people's memories. Hitler was convinced that the Western states had no intention of using force to maintain the Treaty of Versailles. On March 7, 1936, he sent German troops into the Rhineland. This part of Germany was demilitarized by the Treaty of Versailles. Germany was not allowed to have weapons or fortifications there. The French had the right to use force against any violation of this provision. But they would not act without British support, which they did not have. The British government viewed the occupation of German territory by German troops as a reasonable action by a dissatisfied power. The London Times noted that the Germans were =E2=80=9Conly going into their own back garden=E2=80=9D Great Britain began to practice a policy of appeasement. This policy was based on the belief that if European states satisfied the reasonable demands of dissatisfied powers, the dissatisfied powers would be content, and stability and peace would be achieved in Europe. Meanwhile, Hitler gained new allies. Benito Mussolini of Italy dreamed of creating a new Roman Empire. In October 1935, Mussolini's forces invaded Ethiopia. Angered by French and British opposition to his invasion, Mussolini welcomed Hitler's support. He began to draw closer to the German dictator.

German Expansion 1936=E2=80=931939 During the 1930s, Germany annexed areas to the south and east to expand its borders. It also built up its military in the Rhineland, which had been demilitarized after World War I.

GEOGRAPHY CONNECTION
Germany annexed Austria.
Possible response: The Rhine River and its benefits, including rich farmland and transportation, likely attracted disputes over the region. The Rhineland's location on Germany's border also likely added extra attention to the region's political status.
In 1936, both Germany and Italy sent troops to Spain to help General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War. In October 1936, Mussolini and Hitler made an agreement recognizing their common interests. In November, Mussolini spoke of the new alliance between Italy and Germany, which was called the Rome-Berlin Axis. That same month, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which promised a common front against communism.
By 1937, Hitler proclaimed that Germany was once more a =E2=80=9Cworld power.=E2=80=9D He was convinced that neither France nor Great Britain would oppose his plans. In 1938, he decided to pursue his goal of Anschluss (AHN =E2=80=A2 shloos), or union, with Austria, his native land. By threatening Austria with invasion, Hitler forced the Austrian chancellor to put Austrian Nazis in charge of the government. The new government promptly invited German troops to enter Austria and =E2=80=9Chelp=E2=80=9D in maintaining law and order. One day later, on March 13, 1938, Hitler annexed Austria to Germany.
Hitler=E2=80=99s next objective was the destruction of Czechoslovakia. On September 15, 1938, he demanded that Germany be given the Sudetenland, an area in northwestern Czechoslovakia with a mostly German population. He was willing to risk =E2=80=9Cworld war=E2=80=9D to achieve his objective.
British, French, German, and Italian representatives met at a hastily arranged conference in Munich. They did not object to Hitler's plans. Instead, they reached an agreement that met virtually all of his demands. German troops were allowed to occupy the Sudetenland. The Czechs, abandoned by the West, were helpless.
The Munich Conference was the high point of Western appeasement of Hitler. Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, returned to England from Munich and boasted that the agreement meant =E2=80=9Cpeace for our time.=E2=80=9D However, a British statesman named Winston Churchill warned that the settlement at Munich was =E2=80=9Ca disaster of the first magnitude.=E2=80=9D Hitler, however, had promised Chamberlain that he would make no more demands. Like many others, Chamberlain believed Hitler's promises.
In fact, Hitler was more convinced than ever that the Western democracies would not fight. Increasingly, he was sure that he could not make a mistake. He also had not been satisfied by the agreements made at Munich.
In March 1939, Hitler invaded and took control of Bohemia and Moravia in western Czechoslovakia. In the eastern part of the country, Slovakia became a state controlled by Nazi Germany. On the evening of March 15, 1939, Hitler triumphantly declared in Prague that he would be known as the greatest German of them all.

In March 1939, Hitler invaded and took control of Bohemia and Moravia in western Czechoslovakia. In the eastern part of the country, Slovakia became a puppet state controlled by Nazi Germany. On the evening of March 15, 1939, Hitler triumphantly declared in Prague that he would be known as the greatest German of them all.
Japan, under the rule of Emperor Hirohito, was already an imperial power by 1930. It had colonized Taiwan in 1895 and Korea in 1910. It also held extraterritorial privileges in Manchuria in northeastern China to protect Japanese citizens living there. Extraterritorial means taking place outside of the limits of a jurisdiction, or area of authority. These privileges were reaffirmed at the Washington Naval Conference in 1922 with the Nine-Power Treaty signed by the United States, Japan, China, and six European nations with interests in Asia. Japan depended heavily on its colonies for raw materials and as markets for finished goods. To remain industrially strong, Japan had to gain more territory that would provide it with more raw materials and more markets.
This need for more territory was supported by the rise in militarism. Some militants were civilians who were convinced that Western ideas had corrupted the parliamentary system. Others were members of the military who were angered by the cuts in military spending and the government's nonviolent policies of the early 1920s. By the 1930s, civilians had formed extremist patriotic organizations, such as the Black Dragon Society. Members of the army and navy created similar societies. On September 18, 1931, Japanese soldiers disguised themselves as Chinese soldiers. They blew up a small section of the Manchurian Railway near the city of Mukden in northern Manchuria. The soldiers blamed the =E2=80=9CMukden incident=E2=80=9D on the Chinese. They used the event to justify taking all Manchuria in a series of rapid military advances. The Japanese government opposed the conquest, but the Japanese people supported it. The government was unable to act and was soon dominated by the military.
China protested to the League of Nations. In March 1932, the League named Japan an aggressor and told it to return Manchuria to China. The Japanese ignored the League's decision. In March 1933, Japan withdrew from the League. Manchuria was too important to the Japanese economy.
In the Japanese economy, many different manufacturing processes were concentrated into zaibatsus, or large financial and industrial corporations usually run by a family. These vast companies controlled major parts of Japanese industry. The four largest zaibatsu were Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda. They controlled 21 percent of the banking, 26 percent of the mining, 35 percent of the shipbuilding, and more than 60 percent of the paper manufacturing and insurance industries.
The concentration of wealth in the zaibatsu and a rapidly growing population contributed to increasing economic inequality in Japan in the 1930s. Inflation, or increases, in food prices led to food riots. Rapid population growth caused food shortages. Later, during the Great Depression, workers and farmers suffered the most. These hardships made many people want to return to traditional Japanese values. Traditionalists disagreed with the growing influence of Western ideas on Japanese educational and political systems. At the same time, many citizens criticized Japan's attempt to find security through cooperation with the Western powers. Instead, they demanded that Japan use its military strength to dominate Asia. This, many believed, would strengthen its economy and solve its economic problems.
The Japanese continued to make military and economic gains in China. They soon established control over the eastern part of Inner Mongolia and areas in northern China around Beijing. Japan was technically a constitutional monarchy with Emperor Hirohito as head of state. However, neither he nor the democratically elected government leaders could control the military. Japanese society was put on wartime status, and a military draft law was passed in 1938. Economic resources came under strict government control. All political parties were merged into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which called for Japanese expansion abroad. Labor unions were broken apart. Most Western ideas were removed from education and culture.
Meanwhile in China, Chiang Kai-shek tried to avoid a conflict with Japan so he could deal with the Chinese Communists. He considered them a greater threat than Japan. When fighting broke out between Chinese and Japanese troops, he tried to appease Japan by allowing it to govern part of northern China. As Japan moved steadily southward, protests against Japanese aggression grew stronger in Chinese cities. In December 1936, Chiang Kai-shek formed a new united front against the Japanese with the Communists. On the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese forces battled south of Beijing at the Marco Polo Bridge. This event became a full-scale Japanese invasion and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. It was also the beginning of the world war that would be fought in the Pacific.
Although Japan had not planned to declare war on China, the Second Sino-Japanese War turned into a major conflict. Japan seized the Chinese capital of Nanjing on December 9. The Japanese army destroyed the city and massacred more than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war. The event was so brutal it became known as the =E2=80=9CRape of Nanjing.=E2=80=9D Chiang Kai-shek refused to surrender and moved his government upriver. He first moved it to Hankou and then to Chongqing. Temporarily defeated, the Chinese continued to resist.

CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING
In Germany, Adolf Hitler wanted more territory to create his Aryan empire and make Germany a world power. Japan needed supplies of raw materials and new markets for its manufactured goods.
What led to the formal beginning of World War II?
After Germany's invasion of eastern and western Czechoslovakia in March 1939, the Western states reacted to the Nazi threat. Hitler's aggression showed that his promises were worthless. He soon demanded the Lithuanians hand over a part of their territory that contained the city of Memel. This city was once a part of the German state of eastern Prussia. The Lithuanians complied. This would be the last piece of territory the Germans would gain without a fight.
Next, Hitler turned his focus to the nation of Poland, which had been newly re-formed after World War I. When Hitler began to demand the Polish port of Danzig, Great Britain saw the danger and offered to protect Poland in the event of war. At the same time, both France and Britain realized that only the Soviet Union was powerful enough to help contain Nazi aggression. They began political and military negotiations with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, but these failed.
The United States was still suffering the effects of the Great Depression. It continued on a path of nonintervention, or a policy of not becoming involved in the affairs of other countries. Congress passed a series of laws stating the terms of neutrality to prevent the entry of the United States into any foreign wars. These laws were known as Neutrality Acts. They reflected the desire of many Americans to remain isolated from the problems of the rest of the world. These feelings were so strong that Congress held investigations into possible harmful business interests that had led the country to enter World War I.

Meanwhile, Hitler continued to believe that the West would not fight over Poland, just as it had refused to fight to save the Czechs. He now feared, however, that the West and the Soviet Union might make an alliance. Such an alliance could mean a two-front war for Germany. To prevent this, Hitler made his own agreement with Stalin. On August 23, 1939, they signed the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact. In it, the two nations promised not to attack each other. Hitler offered Stalin control of eastern Poland and the Baltic states in exchange for agreement to the pact.
On September 1, German forces invaded western Poland. British prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who had declared =E2=80=9Cpeace in our time=E2=80=9D after the Munich Conference, admitted that Britain's previous policies of appeasement had to be changed. Two days later, on September 3, 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany.

Hitler shocked Europe with the speed and efficiency of the German attack on Poland. His blitzkrieg, or =E2=80=9Clightning war,=E2=80=9D used armored columns called panzer divisions that were supported by airplanes. Each panzer division was a strike force of about 300 tanks with accompanying troops and supplies.
The soldiers of the blitzkrieg broke quickly through Polish lines and encircled the outmatched Polish troops. Regular infantry units then moved in to hold the newly conquered territory. Within four weeks, Poland had surrendered. On September 28, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union divided Poland.
After a winter of waiting, Hitler resumed the attack on April 9, 1940, with a blitzkrieg against Denmark and Norway. One month later, Germany launched an attack on the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The main assault was through Luxembourg and the Ardennes Forest. German panzer divisions broke through weak French defensive positions there and raced across northern France.
French and British forces were taken by surprise. France predicted a German attack and had built a defense system along its border with Germany. This was called the Maginot (MA =E2=80=A2 zhuh =E2=80=A2 NOH) Line. The line was a series of concrete and steel fortifications armed with heavy artillery. The Germans, however, decided not to cross the Maginot Line. Instead, they went around it and attacked France from its border with Belgium.
By going around the Maginot Line, the Germans split the Allied forces, trapping French troops and the entire British army on the beaches of Dunkirk. Only by the heroic efforts of the Royal Navy and civilians in private boats did the British manage to evacuate 338,000 Allied (mostly British) troops.
The French signed an armistice on June 22, 1940. German forces now occupied about three-fifths of France. An authoritarian regime under German control was set up over the remainder of the country. It was known as Vichy France and was led by an aged French hero of World War I named Marshal Henri P=C3=A9tain. Germany was now in control of Western and central Europe, but Britain had still not been defeated. In fact, after Dunkirk, British resolve increased. Winston Churchill had become prime minister in May 1940. His speeches were especially helpful in rallying the British people.

Hitler realized that a land and sea invasion of Britain could succeed only if Germany gained control of the air. At the beginning of August 1940, the German air force, called the Luftwaffe (LOOFT =E2=80=A2 vah =E2=80=A2 fuh), launched a major offensive against Great Britain. German planes bombed British air and naval bases, harbors, communication centers, and war industries. Destruction was widespread.

The British fought back with determination. They were supported by an effective radar system that gave them early warning of German attacks. The British air force still suffered critical losses.
In September, Hitler ordered a shift in strategy in response to a British attack on Berlin. Instead of bombing military targets, the Luftwaffe began massive bombing of British cities, including London. Hitler hoped to break British morale. Instead, the British were able to rebuild their air strength quickly because military targets were not being hit. The British air force was soon inflicting major losses on Luftwaffe bombers. Hitler postponed the invasion of Britain indefinitely.

The German military strategy initially was to strike efficiently and harshly, and to conquer as much foreign territory as possible. Germany also wanted to lower Allied morale.
Why did Japan attack Pearl Harbor?
Japanese military leaders had hoped to force Chiang Kai-shek to agree to join a New Order in East Asia that consisted of Japan, Manchuria, and China. Japan would attempt to establish a new system of control in Asia by guiding its Asian neighbors to prosperity.
Part of Japan's plan was to seize Soviet Siberia because it had rich natural resources. During the late 1930s, Japan began to cooperate with Nazi Germany. Japanese leaders assumed that the two countries would eventually launch a joint attack on the Soviet Union and divide Soviet resources between them.
When Germany signed the nonaggression pact with the Soviets in August 1939, Japanese leaders had to rethink their goals. Japan lacked the resources to defeat the Soviet Union. Japanese leaders looked to Southeast Asia for raw materials to support their military.

Part of Japan's plan was to seize Soviet Siberia, with its rich natural resources. During the late 1930s, Japan began to cooperate with Nazi Germany. Japanese leaders assumed that the two countries would ultimately launch a joint attack on the Soviet Union and divide Soviet resources between them.
When Germany signed the nonaggression pact with the Soviets in August 1939, Japanese leaders had to rethink their goals. Because Japan lacked the resources to defeat the Soviet Union, leaders looked to Southeast Asia for raw materials for the Japanese military machine.
Japanese leaders knew that a move southward would be seen as especially aggressive and risk a war with the European powers and the United States. Japan's attack on China had already caused strong criticism, especially in the United States. In the summer of 1940, its leaders demanded the right to use economic resources in the French colonies in Southeast Asia.
The United States, as expected, objected to these demands. U.S. officials warned Japan that they would apply economic sanctions unless Japan withdrew from the area and returned to its borders of 1931. Japan badly needed the oil and scrap iron it was getting from the United States. Japan would have to find these resources elsewhere if the United States stopped providing them. Losing access to these resources would threaten Japan's long-term objectives.
Japan was now caught in a dilemma. To guarantee access to raw materials in Southeast Asia, Japan had to risk losing them from the United States. After much debate, Japan decided to launch a surprise attack on U.S. and European colonies in Southeast Asia. Japan also took advantage of Hitler's conquests in Western Europe and the powerlessness of many European powers to seize European colonies in Asia. However, Japanese leaders realized that American power in the Pacific could block further conquests, which helped lead the Japanese to attack the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.
A move southward, Japanese leaders knew, would be seen as especially aggressive and risk a war with the European powers and the United States.

Its leaders demanded the right to exploit economic resources in the French colonies in Southeast Asia.

U.S. officials warned Japan that they would apply economic sanctions unless Japan withdrew from the area and returned to its borders of 1931.

Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The surprise attack damaged or destroyed more than 350 aircraft, damaged or sank 18 ships, and killed or wounded more than 3,500 Americans. The same day, the Japanese attacked the Philippines and advanced on Malaya. Later, they invaded the Dutch East Indies and occupied several islands in the Pacific Ocean. By the spring of 1942, almost all Southeast Asia and much of the western Pacific had fallen to the Japanese.
Japanese policy was now largely controlled by Prime Minister Hideki T=C5=8Dj=C5=8D, who was a former general. Over the course of the war, he became a military dictator. Before the conflict, he had served in Japan's embassy in Berlin and supported a Japanese alliance with both Germany and Italy. T=C5=8Dj=C5=8D had hoped Japan's lightning strikes at American bases would destroy the U.S. fleet in the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration, he thought, would now accept Japanese domination of the Pacific.
But the Japanese miscalculated. The attack on Pearl Harbor changed American public opinion. More Americans now supported the entry of the U.S. into the war. The United States joined with European nations and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist China in a combined effort to defeat Japan. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler believed that American involvement in the Pacific would make the United States ineffective in the European conflict. He declared war on the United States four days after Pearl Harbor.

From the number of ships that are smoking or sinking, it looks like the attack did a lot of damage.
Remembering the lesson of World War I, Hitler had no desire for a two-front war. He became convinced that Britain was remaining in the conflict only because it expected Soviet support. If the Soviet Union was defeated, Britain's last hope would be gone. Hitler was convinced the Soviet Union could be defeated quickly. He was also motivated by his goal to get rid of communism, which he considered a threat to fascist Germany.
Hitler=E2=80=99s invasion of the Soviet Union was scheduled for the spring of 1941, but the attack was delayed because of problems in the Balkans and further south in Greece. Hitler had already gained the political cooperation of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. However, the failure of Mussolini's invasion of Greece in 1940 had exposed Germany's southern forces to British air bases in Greece. To secure the Balkan region, Hitler seized both Greece and Yugoslavia in April. These actions, however, delayed the German plans for the Soviet invasion.
Reassured, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. This act betrayed the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact signed in 1939. He believed the Soviets could still be decisively defeated before the brutal winter weather set in. The massive attack stretched along a front that was 1,800 miles (about 2,900 km) long. German troops advanced rapidly, capturing 2 million Russian soldiers. By November, one German army group had swept through Ukraine. A second group was surrounding the city of Leningrad. A third had approached within 25 miles (about 40 km) of Moscow, the Soviet capital.
An early winter and fierce Soviet resistance, however, stopped the German advance. The Germans had not planned for winter uniforms because they had been sure of a quick victory. For the first time in the war, German armies had been stopped. A Soviet army counterattack in December 1941 came as an ominous ending to the year for the Germans. Ominous means suggesting something bad is going to happen in the future.
Critical to the Soviet war effort was a steady flow of military supplies from Britain and the United States. These supplies came over an overland route in Iran known as the Persian Corridor. The route was created after British and Soviet forces invaded Iran at the same time on August 26, 1941. The occupation of Iran proved very important to the Allied cause and transformed Iran=E2=80=99s road and rail networks. It also brought Iran, which had diplomatic relations with Germany, closer to the Western powers. However, the presence of foreign troops in Iran may have inspired nationalism that led to social change in the country.

Both countries wanted to gain control over as much territory as possible. Japan wanted to use the land to acquire raw materials. Germany wanted to resettle the land it conquered with German peasants to expand the so-called Aryan race.
What was the significance of the American victory in the Battle of Midway?
The entry of the United States and other countries into the war turned it into a global conflict, similar to World War I. A new alliance known as the Allies formed. The three major Allies were Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. They agreed to focus on military operations and to ignore political and economic differences. This alliance later became known as the Grand Alliance.
As Japanese forces advanced into Southeast Asia and the Pacific throughout 1942, German forces continued to win the fighting in Europe and North Africa. But in 1943, the Allies agreed to fight until the Axis Powers surrendered unconditionally, or completely. The Axis Powers were Germany, Italy, and Japan. This resolve strengthened the Grand Alliance and made it nearly impossible for Hitler and the other Axis nations to divide their enemies. There would be no separate peace treaties. The Allies were committed to fight to the end.

Shortly after their attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces turned to the Philippines. From January to April 1942, Filipino and American soldiers fought the Japanese in the Battle of Bataan but finally surrendered. The Japanese took an estimated 76,000 Filipinos and Americans prisoner and forced them to march 66 miles (106 km) from the Bataan Peninsula to Camp O'Donnell, a makeshift prison. The exact number of prisoners who survived this march is unknown. It is estimated that as many as 2,000 American and 28,000 Filipino soldiers died as a result of the march. Many died from starvation and disease. This became known as the Bataan Death March.
The fighting forced General Douglas MacArthur, the U.S. Army commander in the Pacific, to evacuate the Philippines for Australia. A month after Bataan, the Japanese defeated American and Filipino forces in the Battle of Corregidor. This completed their conquest of the Philippines.
In its Asian conquests, the Japanese army forced women to serve as sexual slaves in military brothels, known as =E2=80=9Ccomfort houses.=E2=80=9D There were hundreds of thousands of these =E2=80=9Ccomfort women.=E2=80=9D They mainly came from Korea and China, but others came from elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In recent years, South Korea has pressed the Japanese government for restitution, or payment for damages, for the treatment of these women. On December 28, 2015, Japan and South Korea came to an agreement. Japan issued an apology and agreed to supply nearly $8.3 million each year in support for the remaining victims.

In 1942, the war in the Pacific changed dramatically. In the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 7 and 8, 1942, American naval forces stopped the Japanese advance and prevented the invasion of Australia. The turning point in Asia came on June 4 at the Battle of Midway Island. U.S. planes destroyed four attacking Japanese aircraft carriers. The American victory at Midway ensured that Japan would be fighting on the defensive for the rest of World War II.
By the fall of 1942, Allied forces in the Pacific were gathering for two operations. One was commanded by U.S. general Douglas MacArthur. It would move into the Philippines through New Guinea and the South Pacific islands. The other was commanded by U.S. admiral Chester Nimitz. It would move across the Pacific with a combination of air, land, and sea attacks on Japanese-held islands. This strategy came to be known as =E2=80=9Cisland-hopping.=E2=80=9D It was designed to capture some Japanese-held islands while ignoring others in an effort to quickly reach Japan. Island-hopping required fewer troops and ensured enemy forces could not retreat to reinforce other defensive positions, such as in the Philippines.
In 1943, the United States Armed Forces Far East was largely composed of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Filipino guerrilla forces. It continued to fight the Japanese in the Philippines. This resistance movement would prove important to later success for the Allies. As U.S. forces and their allies continued the island-hopping campaign, Japanese fortunes began to fade.

In 1942, German forces broke through the British defenses in Egypt and advanced toward the important port city of Alexandria. The Suez Canal was very important to the Allied war effort. It was under threat of capture.
But the situation quickly changed. British forces stopped General Erwin Rommel=E2=80=99s troops at the battle of El Alamein in the summer of 1942. The Germans then retreated back across the desert. In November 1942, British and American forces invaded French North Africa. They forced the German and Italian troops there to surrender in May 1943.

On the Eastern Front, after the capture of the Crimea, Hitler's generals wanted him to concentrate on the Caucasus and its oil fields. Hitler, however, decided that Stalingrad, a major industrial center on the Volga River, should be taken first. In perhaps the most terrible and brutal battle of the war, between November 1942 and February 2, 1943, the Soviets launched a counterattack. German troops were stopped and then encircled. Supply lines were cut off during frigid winter conditions. The Germans were forced to surrender at Stalingrad. The entire German Sixth Army, considered the best of the German troops, was defeated.
By February 1943, German forces in Russia were back to the positions they had held in June 1942. By spring, even Hitler knew that the Germans would not defeat the Soviet Union.

The frigid conditions caused difficulties for German troops, and they were forced to surrender at Stalingrad.
Possible response: Hitler believed the Treaty of Versailles unfairly limited Germany's power, and he violated it as part of the first steps in his plan to take over Europe. He also believed European powers would not use force if he violated the treaty.
Possible response: World War II formally began when Hitler invaded Poland. France and Britain declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939.
Possible response: Japan attacked Pearl Harbor as part of a way to get access to raw materials in Southeast Asia. Japan also hoped to destroy the U.S. Pacific fleet and weaken the ability of the U.S. to fight in the Pacific. 
Possible response: The Battle of Midway was a turning point in the war in the Pacific. Japan's military was fighting to defend itself for the rest of the war.
5. Summarizing Using your notes and the text, complete the table by typing your response in the answer box below. Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about World War II for each of the time periods.
Answers will vary. Students should write one sentence to show an understanding of important events in each time period, such as German Aggression: 1920 to 1938: Germany needed more territory for Hitler to build his Aryan state, and European nations largely ignored his violations of the Treaty of Versailles and aggression against nearby nations.; Japanese Aggression: 1920 to 1938: Japan wanted to build a New Order in Asia, and the government was unable to prevent the military from acting aggressively.; World War II: 1939 to 1940: The war began when Hitler invaded Poland, and he was very successful in his conquests, except against Great Britain.; World War II: 1941: The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Hitler's attack against the Soviet Union brought more nations into the war, making it a global conflict.; World War II: 1942 to 1943: Japan conquered the Philippines, but the U.S. victory at Midway helped the Allies get control of the Pacific, and German forces unsuccessfully tried to take Stalingrad.
Responses will vary depending on the battle selected. Students should describe the battle from the perspective of a soldier.
Student responses will vary but should show an understanding of fascist governments becoming dominated by the military to fulfill imperial ambitions. In Germany, Hitler wanted to create an empire populated with a superior Aryan race. In Italy, Mussolini wanted to create a new Roman empire. In Japan, Hirohito needed access to raw materials and new economic markets.
