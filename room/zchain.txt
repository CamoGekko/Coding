scan ports, port 22 hides itself unless you use random scans

port 8000 is open with a web server on it

the server claims to be under dev but a secret dir(which you can guess because the name of 
the hacker group is that) contains what you need

you still need a username and password to login as zenith, they are both located in the zenithadmin.dll
as Matt Burchowski. You only know he is correct because if you downloaded a file named zenith.png
and analyzed it as a txt it says his name at the bottom (Matt is in zenith.png)

now use Matts password and the zenith username to login to the computer on ftp. 

zenith.dll is now useful because in auth.log a user named bob.jones accessed the computer as root
so you find his password and use it to log into ssh on his account

the passwd file is vulnerable to modifications do to misconfiguration so you can add a root user
or
you can use the tar.sh file that is improperly configured and allows for command injection and
running commands as root

use your newly aquired root permissions to find the enterprise.dll file, recover it and delete it
from their system
