Make a local python3 server that runs with sensitive data

Make user zenith and disallow permissions to make it harder

In the web server /zenith has a base64 encoded ssh key, make a user for this so they
can only use ftp to browse the file system, allowing you to find zeniths ssh key

The second more secure file contains a username and password for the root 
user in the computer system and then begin the actual forensics and recovery
in the root directory, contained in a bin.dll file that actually contains
plaintext hexadecimal data

add a second extremely secure file with admin passwords encoded multiple time 
with hexadecimal and binary

Make the user have to figure out how to run killps.sh in order to allow ssh via killing mon21.sh
